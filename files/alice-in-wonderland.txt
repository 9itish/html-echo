Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and having nothing to do.
Once or twice, she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.
"And what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"
She was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies.
The hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid.
Suddenly, a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing very remarkable about that.
Nor did Alice think it was unusual to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"
When she thought about it later, she realized she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time, it all seemed quite natural.
However, when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket, looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice jumped to her feet.
It flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it.
Burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it.
Fortunately, she was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge.
In another moment, Alice went down after it, never once considering how she was to get out again.
The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some distance and then dipped suddenly downward.
Alice had no time to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she was falling very slowly, for she had plenty of time to look around and wonder what was going to happen next.
First, she tried to look down and see where she was going, but it was too dark.
Then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves.
Here and there, she saw maps and pictures hanging on pegs.
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed.
It was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her great disappointment, it was empty.
She did not want to drop the jar for fear of hitting someone below, so she managed to place it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
"Well!" thought Alice to herself.
"After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down the stairs!"
"How brave they'll all think me at home!"
"Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!"
Which was very likely true.
Down, down, down.
Would the fall never come to an end?
"I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud.
"I must be getting somewhere near the center of the Earth."
"Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—"
Alice had learned several things of this sort in her schoolroom lessons, and though this was not the best time to show off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen, it was still good practice to say it aloud.
"—Yes, that's about the right distance, but then I wonder what latitude or longitude I've reached?"
Alice had no idea what latitude or longitude actually were, but she thought they were nice, grand words to say.
Presently, she began again.
"I wonder if I shall fall right through the Earth!"
"How funny it will seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!"
"The Antipathies, I think—"
She was rather glad no one was listening this time, as it didn't sound like the right word at all.
"—But I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know."
"Please, ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"
She tried to curtsy as she spoke—imagine curtsying while falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?
"And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!"
"No, that will never do; perhaps I shall see it written somewhere."
Down, down, down.
There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.
"Dinah will miss me very much tonight, I should think!"
"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time."
"Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me!"
"There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very much like a mouse, you know."
"But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"
At this point, Alice began to feel rather sleepy.
She went on repeating to herself in a dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?"
Sometimes she would say, "Do bats eat cats?"
Since she couldn't answer either question, it didn't really matter which way she put it.
She felt herself dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah.
She was saying to her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?"
Suddenly—thump! Thump!
Down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
Alice was not hurt one bit, and she jumped to her feet in an instant.
She looked up, but it was all dark overhead.
Before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
There was no time to lose.
Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"
She was close behind it as she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.
She found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the ceiling.
There were doors all around the hall, but they were all locked.
Alice walked down one side and up the other, trying every door.
When she found them all locked, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly, she came upon a little three-legged table made entirely of solid glass.
There was nothing on it except a tiny golden key.
Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors in the hall.
But, alas! Either the locks were too large, or the key was too small.
In any case, it would not open any of them.
However, on her second time around, she noticed a low curtain she had not seen before.
Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high.
She tried the tiny golden key in the lock.
To her great delight, it fit!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat hole.
She knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander among those beds of bright flowers and cool fountains!
But she could not even get her head through the doorway.
"And even if my head would go through," thought poor Alice, "it would be of very little use without my shoulders."
"Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!"
"I think I could if I only knew how to begin."
For, you see, so many strange things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things were truly impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table.
She half hoped she might find another key on it or at least a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes.
This time, she found a little bottle on the table.
"Which certainly was not here before," said Alice.
Around the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed in large letters.
It was all very well to say "Drink me," but wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry.
"No, I'll look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked 'poison' or not."
She had read several little stories about children who had been burned, eaten by wild beasts, and suffered other unpleasant fates, all because they failed to remember the simple rules their friends had taught them.
For example, a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long.
If you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds.
And, most importantly, if you drink much from a bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later.
However, this bottle was not marked "poison," so Alice ventured to taste it.
Finding it very nice—(it had, in fact, a mixed flavor of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast)—she quickly finished it off.
"What a curious feeling!" said Alice.
"I must be shutting up like a telescope."
And so it was indeed.
She was now only ten inches high.
Her face brightened at the thought that she was finally the right size to go through the little door into that lovely garden.
First, however, she waited a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further.
She felt a little nervous about this.
"For it might end, you know," said Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle."
"I wonder what I should be like then?"
She tried to imagine what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out.
But she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided to go into the garden at once.
But, alas for poor Alice!
When she got to the door, she realized she had forgotten the little golden key.
She went back to the table for it, only to find that she could not possibly reach it.
She could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery.
When she had tired herself out from trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
"Come, there’s no use in crying like that!" said Alice to herself rather sharply.
"I advise you to stop this minute!"
She generally gave herself very good advice, though she very seldom followed it.
Sometimes, she even scolded herself so severely that it brought tears to her eyes.
Once, she even remembered trying to box her own ears for cheating herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself.
This curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
"But it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people!
Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!"
Soon, her eye fell on a little glass box lying under the table.
She opened it and found a very small cake inside, on which the words "EAT ME" were beautifully marked in currants.
"Well, I'll eat it," said Alice.
"If it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key.
And if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door.
So either way, I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"
She ate a little bit and anxiously said to herself, "Which way? Which way?"
She held her hand on top of her head to feel which way she was growing.
To her surprise, she remained the same size.
Of course, this is what usually happens when one eats cake.
But Alice had gotten so used to expecting nothing but out-of-the-ordinary things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the usual way.
"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice.
She was so surprised that, for the moment, she quite forgot how to speak proper English.
"Now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
Goodbye, feet!"
When she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight—they were getting so far away.
"Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
I'm sure I shan't be able!
I'll be far too big to bother with you.
You'll have to manage the best you can.
But I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go!
Let me see... I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas."
She went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
"They must go by the carrier," she thought.
"And how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet!
And how odd the directions will look!
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!"
Just then, her head struck against the roof of the hall.
In fact, she was now more than nine feet tall.
She quickly picked up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
Poor Alice!
She lay down on one side and could just barely peek through into the garden with one eye.
But getting through was more hopeless than ever.
She sat down and began to cry again.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice.
"A great girl like you," (and she had a point), "crying like this!
Stop this moment, I tell you!"
But she kept crying all the same.
She shed so many tears that a large pool formed around her, about four inches deep, stretching halfway down the hall.
After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance.
She hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other.
He came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he went, “Oh! The Duchess, the Duchess!
Oh! Won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!”
Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask anyone for help.
So, when the Rabbit came near her, she began in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—”
The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and scurried away into the darkness as fast as he could go.
Alice picked up the fan and gloves, and as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself while she talked.
“Dear, dear! How queer everything is today!
And yesterday, things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night?
Let me think—was I the same when I got up this morning?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
But if I’m not the same, the next question is: Who in the world am I?
Ah, that’s the great puzzle!”
She began thinking over all the children she knew who were the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all.
And I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she—oh! She knows so very little!
Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
I’ll see if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see—four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear!
I shall never get to twenty at this rate!
However, the multiplication table doesn’t matter.
Let’s try geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain!
I must have been changed for Mabel!
I’ll try to say ‘How doth the little—’”
She crossed her hands on her lap as if she were reciting a lesson and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come out the way they used to.
“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again.
She went on, “I must be Mabel after all.
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! Ever so many lessons to learn!
No, I’ve made up my mind about it—if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here!
It’ll be no use for them to put their heads down and say, ‘Come up again, dear!’
I shall only look up and say, ‘Who am I then?
Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up.
If not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else.’
But, oh dear!” cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put their heads down!
I am so very tired of being all alone here!”
As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking.
“How can I have done that?” she thought.
“I must be growing small again.”
She got up and went to the table to measure herself against it.
She found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high and still shrinking rapidly.
She soon realized that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily—just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
